# Discord RPC

This is a library for interfacing your game with a locally running Discord desktop client.
It's known to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can use the lib directly if you like, or use it as a guide to writing your own if it doesn't suit your game as is. PRs/feedback welcome if you have an improvement everyone might want, or can describe how this doesn't meet your needs.

Included here are some quick demos that implement the very minimal subset to show current status, and have callbacks for where a more complete game would do more things (joining, spectating, etc).
